# Promise Queue Pipeline

*codename pending :)*

### Abstract
Are you brimming with adoration for the lovely, functional syntax that Javascript provides?

Do you like linking methods together in a sick chain?

Have you ever been held back by asynchronous methods that keep promising you `this` and that??
